This repository contains a Python function with a potential `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected and more robust version. The error is a common one, caused by dividing by zero which is mathematically undefined.  The solution demonstrates a simple way to avoid the error and increase the robustness of the function.
